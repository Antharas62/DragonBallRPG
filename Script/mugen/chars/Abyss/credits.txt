-----------------------------------------
 I got the abyss sprites from a sprite pack that was released by thor. I also got some form1
sprites from a sprite back by wuwo off mugenchina. Eternaga made the great
portrait! I got all the sounds from a sound rip pack that was released by Cloudius & 
One Winged Angel. Major thanks goes all to all of them, without them this project would 
not have been possible. Especially since thor's abyss sprite pack seemed to have fallen 
off the edge of the earth, luckily cloudius still had it :)

Info:
------
 Abyss was mostly intended to be a port from his MVC2 counterpart. There was one move
in which I was not able to fit in because the sprite's were missing, however he has 
something in place of that attack that is very similar. He doesn't change into orb form
in form 3 (the orb was a 3d render in mvc2), as of right now this is as close to a port
that i could get him to.
